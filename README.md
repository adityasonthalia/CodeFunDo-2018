# CodeFunDo-2018
First repository on GitHub! 
So, the idea I and my team are up with is that we design an app/website which acts as a platform for better connectivity among individuals who are affected by a disaster/natural calamaity or are in the danger to get affected and the necessary resourceful help providers. A common go-to point for NGOs, Govt. organisations, scientists and state/city/town representatives to work out any such problem efficiently is what we seek to achieve.
